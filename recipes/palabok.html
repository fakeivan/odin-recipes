    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pancit Palabok is a variation of pancit, a classic dish many Filipinos enjoy. Despite the many different kinds of pancit in the country, palabok is easily recognized by certain trademark characteristics: its thin noodles and orange sauce in particular. Some say that one synonym of palabok is “salsa na malapot” –– meaning, a sauce that is gooey and viscous in nature. </p>

    <p>However, the orange color of palabok's sauce doesn't come from the orange fruit; instead, palabok sauce is usually a combination of pork broth, shrimp cubes, ground pork, and annatto powder. The latter is the reason behind these noodles’ bright and refreshing appearance.</p>
